When displaying an error state in the entire screen, use the `ErrorScreen` widget in 'error_screen.dart'.

Basic usage:
```
ErrorScreen(errorMessage: error')
```

If you need to trigger a retry action:
```
ErrorScreen(errorMessage: error, onRetry: onRetry)
```


Another way to display error states is through the SnackBar
TODO: decide if we want to change error handling conventions here.
SnackBar:
- perform initial action, set state
- if mounted vs not mounted action.
