## Phase 2: Math Blocks

1. LaTex is not rendered when i tried two libraries: react-native-katex and react-native-webview, that logseq purportedly uses.
2. In its current state we render a monospace display like a codeblock
3. The goal is to render Latex blocks, and it should work cross platform

## Phase 2: Wikilink overlay
- doesn't always trigger on typing....

## Phase 2: Image blocks
- it only makes sense to implement this when I am on desktop. I rarely attach screenshots on mobile.

## Phase 3: Search
- real time filtering does not filter what's not retrieved from the initial page, it should be a backend call.
- it's also complicated because if I have something in the local repository, I should retrieve those. 

- fix themes: it's currently very weird.

- on web: keyboard shortcuts

- fix focus issues!
