## Phase 2: Wikilink overlay
- doesn't always trigger on typing....
- totally fix it!!!! figure out how to position it properly in mobile
Figure out how to make it clickable

## Phase 2: Image blocks (web)
- it only makes sense to implement this when I am on desktop. I rarely attach screenshots on mobile.

- fix themes: it's currently very weird.

- on web: keyboard shortcuts

- fix focus issues!
